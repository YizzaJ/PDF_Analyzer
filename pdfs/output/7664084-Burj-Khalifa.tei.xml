<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Determination or prayer and fasting times is an obligation for Muslims as one of the requirements for the validity of the worship rituals. The period of time for the implementation of prayer and fasting is set following the movement of the sun resulting from the Earth revolution about its axis. Earth"s 24-hour revolution from west to east bringing about the apparent rising of the sun from the east and its setting in the west is an important factor in determining the time. However, a confusing situation arises for Muslims in determining the actual time for performing worship rituals when they are in high-rise buildings which are in the same position coordinates but at different heights as in towers and skyscraper buildings. This study intends to discuss the time zones with respect to determination of the worshipping time at the tallest skyscraper building in the world at this time i.e., Burj Khalifa. This study is qualitative research using an approach of document analysis. The results of the study found that height difference at Burj Khalifa gives rise to three different time zones according to the altitude. This can serve as a guide to other countries especially Malaysia which also has skyscrapers in the determination of prayer times in such buildings.</p><p>Copy Right, IJAR, 2023,.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>…………………………………………………………………………………………………….... Introduction:-</head><p>One of the requirements for worship is to know the time for prayer. Every person who adheres to the religion of Islam is obliged to ascertain when the time for each obligatory prayer starts and ends. This is in line with the methodology of Islamic jurisprudence (al-Nadawi 1994): "A matter without which the obligatory will not be complete, then the matter is mandatory".If time is not a condition for whether or not a prayer is valid, then one can just fulfil the obligation of prayer at any time, before or after the period of time a prayer should be performed. Determination of the time for prayer is already explained in the fiqh book whereby determination of time for each prayer requires for a reference to the movement of the sun.According 1809 shadows or by measuring the length of working time; and (c) Imitation or taqlid. In case of it is an improbability of knowing the time with certainty, or ijtihad on the times for prayers and their arguments, one should do taqlid following those who are knowledgeable of them with clear daleel or a mujtahid who holds on to strong daleel or argument or evidence. Furthermore, falak scholars or experts in the field of astronomy nowadays have already set certain formulas and methods for calculating prayer times throughout the year to facilitate the Muslims. Therefore, Muslim community in a place only need to follow them and refer to the timetable of prayer times which is pre-determined by the religious authority under respective governments and communities need not to carry out ijtihad in determining their own prayer times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determination of Prayer Time according to Islamic Legal Sources</head><p>Division of prayers into five times in a day involves observing the movement of sun for ascertaining each prayer time, with position of the sun being the main reference point. This can be authenticated from Quranic verses and hadiths that explain times prayer. In the Quran, Allah SWT says: "Establish prayer at the decline of the sun (from its meridian) until the darkness of the night and (also) the Quran of dawn. Indeed, the recitation of dawn is ever witnessed" (al-Isra": 78). While in a Hadith, the Prophet Muhammad SAW said: "The time of Zuhr prayer remains till the sun declines and the shadow of a man becomes double of his length and so long as the Asr prayer does not come; and the time of Asr prayer remains so long as the sun does not become yellow; and the time of Maghrib prayer remains so long as the red hue does not disappear; and the time for Isha' prayer remains up to the midnight; and the time for Fajr prayer runs from the appearance of dawn till the sun does not rise; but when the sun rises, keep away from prayer; because it rises between two horn of the devils" (Narrated by Imam Muslim).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time Differences and Changes based on the Motion of the Sun</head><p>Each zone or area in a state or country has different prayer times and they will not remain the same at a single point in time only. This is already taken into account based on the situation that the earth rotates on its axis, always showing different movement of the sun which is measured from an observer or based on the height of an observation point from the sea level. The sun"s movement affects each prayer time for a location due to the sun"s inclination and declination causing its altitude and meridian time (istiwa') to change <ref type="bibr" coords="2,349.05,396.27,70.18,9.00" target="#b9">(Haron et al. 2009</ref>).</p><p>On November 29, 2019, an official media statement was released by the Director-General of the Malaysian Islamic Development Department or Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malaysia (JAKIM) after a meeting with the National Council Muzakarah Committee for Malaysian Islamic Religious Affairs or the Jawatankuasa Muzakarah Majlis Kebangsaan Bagi Hal-Ehwal Ugama Islam Malaysia (MKI) concerning the decision of adding an extra eight minutes for beginning time of the dawn prayer (fajr prayer) throughout Malaysia. The event happened due to a newly found discovery after research was done that gave the result that a change had occurred to the altitude parameter of the sun from 20° to 18° below the horizon, which complies to the beginning of true dawn (fajr sadiq). Each 1° of the earth rotation is equivalent to a duration time of four minutes; therefore, the existing prayer starting time for dawn prayer need an additional eight minutes delay following the found 2° difference on the altitude parameter of the sun (Office of the Mufti of Federal Territory 2019).</p><p>The difference in prayer times can also be seen not only because of following the time zone and highland areas as those which have been set in Malaysia, in fact the existence of issues that arises in the past few years concerns the time of prayer in skyscraper buildings such as Burj Khalifa in Dubai. A detailed study on this has not been carried out until now. Muslim community in such places suffices themselves by depending on the fatwa and opinion of the mufti only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Burj Khalifa as the Tallest Skyscraper in the World</head><p>Burj Khalifa or the Khalifa Tower, formerly known as Burj Dubai, is the tallest skyscraper building constructed in Dubai, The United Arab Emirates which holds the record of being the tallest human-constructed structure ever developed in world history and no others have been able to surpass such construction since its building was completed in 2010 until today. The building records a height of 2,717 feet which is approximately 828 meters <ref type="bibr" coords="2,72.03,672.32,4.29,9.00">(</ref>  The skyscraper structure has 163 floors including three observation decks on levels 124, 125 and 148. Residences and hotels are placed on levels 9-108, while offices occupy levels 109-154 (Aldred 2020). As the record holder for the world's tallest tower, Burj Khalifa also achieves the records of being the highest swimming pool ever constructed located on the 76 th level and having the highest observation deck space in the world on the 124 th floor. Burj Khalifa developer denied concerning the record of the world's highest mosque ever constructed, even though hundreds of media reports stated as such <ref type="bibr" coords="3,186.52,131.59,62.34,9.00" target="#b12">(Simpson 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prayer Time Zone Determination at Burj Khalifa</head><p>The uniqueness of praying at Burj Khalifa is that residents and visitors to the place fulfil their prayers not following the time zone only for each level. Determination of prayer time zones at Burj Khalifa has been divided into three time zones according to the floor levels. This was already made a fatwa by Dr. Ahmed Al Haddad, Grand Mufti at the Department of Islamic Affairs of Dubai. In an interview on Emirates Today media, Al Haddad gave a verdict that occupants of the tower at Burj Khalifa need to take their sehri earlier (before the time for Fajr prayer) and break their fast later (after the start of Maghrib prayer time) accordingly according to three different times. A time difference was found between the highest levels and the lowest levels closest to the ground level at the tower, especially during Maghrib, Isha' and Subh or Fajr prayers <ref type="bibr" coords="3,308.43,246.62,51.23,9.00" target="#b8">(Ghazal 2011</ref>).</p><p>The height of Burj Khalifa which nearly hit one kilometre surely gives an effect to the views of its residents and visitors at each and every level in the tower when seeing the sun rises and sets. At the start of the sun rising at the time of dawn, the highest levels will experience the appearance of sunlight first, earlier than the levels way below. Likewise at dusk, the people who are on the lowest levels will experience darkness and see the sunset earlier than the occupants on highest levels above them.</p><p>Therefore, Muslims on the top levels will experience a longer fasting period than those who are at the lowest levels because of the time of dawn at their spot comes earlier by a few minutes and Maghrib and Isha' time will also be a little later. See the diagram below of a sketch for knowing the time zone according to the level and height of the tower.   Calculation for the commencement of the dawn prayer time is considered when the sun appears in sight below the horizon at an angle of 18°. When residents in the third zone already experience fajr sadiq, position of the sun that can be seen by the residents in the second and first time zones are at an angle of 17.75° and 17.25° respectively. Therefore the difference in altitude degrees result in different calculation for prayer time due to the fact that every 1° of earth rotation takes 4 minutes.</p><p>As an example, if today is June 15, 2022, the dawn prayer time in the district of Dubai starts at 3:59 am, then residents in the first zone in the tower will follow the same time. Meanwhile, residents in the second zone already experience fajr sadiq at 3:57 am and in the third zone at 3:56 am. Similar calculation is done for Maghrib and Isha' prayers which come later by about 2-3 minutes than the local prayer time. Determination of the time for prayers in the third zone is not different by 2 minutes but by 1 minute only to the second zone because the height altitude range in the third zone is counted as half, considering that only up to level 160 of Burj Khalifa is used and the rest is the pinnacle structure of the tower (Anon 2022).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:-</head><p>Determination of prayer time need to go through the process of observation of sunrise and sunset phenomena. After the research was done, results showed that residents in the areas of higher altitude will see sunrise earlier and sunset later. Therefore, for occupants of the tower who are on the top floors exceeding 0.5° of altitude from sea level, their time zone for prayer will be earlier at Fajr time and later at Maghrib and Isha'.This phenomenon too has an effect on the determination for the fasting time period. Though the difference is not significant and only involves a few minutes only, setting the right time is a duty and need to be known by Muslims because this matter involves the condition of validity of prayer and fasting worships. However, detailed formulae used in calculation for the degree of altitude and obligatory prayer times are not included yet. Hence, this research needs to be continued by future researchers to achieve more in-depth and extensive account for each time zone in skyscraper buildings</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="1,361.66,686.15,178.26,9.00;1,72.03,697.55,467.71,9.00;1,72.03,709.15,467.59,9.00;1,87.23,737.95,185.38,9.00;1,87.23,749.15,379.76,9.00;1,87.23,761.15,203.37,9.00"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>to al-Khin et al.
